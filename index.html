        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cs.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a> (Class of 2024). Before that I attended Legend High School (Class of 2020) where I was a multi-year state champion and national finalist at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tsaweb.org">Technology Student Association's</a> software development competition.</p>
        <p>When I am not working on school and software, I am most likely hanging out with my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.minessae.org/">Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> fraternity brothers or playing baseball for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://minesathletics.com/sports/cbsb/schedule">Mines Club Baseball</a> team.</p>

                <p>I spent 3 years working for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fractyldev.com/">Fractyl Development</a>, a startup myself and three others created. I worked as our full-stack iOS developer. We brought three apps to market under our company, and built one for an external client. I worked almost entirely in Swift, and I used Google Cloud and Node.js for the server side.</p>

                <p>This summer, I interned at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://opticalenginesinc.com/">Optical Engines</a>, a laser research and development company. I built laser calibration software to fit the needs of the optics researchers and engineers. I used C++ and C# with WPF on this project. I also added features to their in-house CRM software using React and Python.</p>

                <p>Waypoint Communication is a location based social media app that facilitates connections between users in the real world by acting as a live map where you can see what is happening all around you. Users can drop "pins" on their location to invite people to a pick-up basketball game, a festival, or to show off a cool picture of wildlife. The possibilities are endless.  <a href="http://waypoint.fractyldev.com/index.html">Check it out!</a></p>

                <h3>The Morse Project</h3>
                <h5>Java</h5>
                <p>The Morse Project turns your phone into a Morse Code receiver. Any messages sent to you will automatically be vibrated into Morse Code, so that you and only you can understand what your texts say, without the hassle of pulling out your phone. Initially built to assist the blind, after getting 2,000+ downloads in the first weeks we realized this app benefits everyone who wants to "read" their texts without ever pulling out their phone. The app also includes tools to teach yourself Morse code so anyone can use the app.  <a href="https://fractyldev.com/morse/about.html">Check it out!</a> </p>
