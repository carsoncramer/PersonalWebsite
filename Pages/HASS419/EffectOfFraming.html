        In 2010, British Petroleum released approximately 3.2 million barrels of
        oil into the ocean. In addition to mitigating over 900 million kilograms
        of carbon dioxide being relesased into the atmosphere by burning this
        oil, there has been a boom in specific plankton, coral, and bacteria
        populations.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        Koray Ozhan is a professor at Louisiana State University and works in
        the Department of Oceanography and Costal Sciences. In a
        <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/9/829/269288"
          >journal article</a
        >
        published in BioScience, he says "Remote sensing analyses suggest that
        the [BP Oil Release] stimulated phytoplankton growth." This boom in
        phytoplankton population will pay dividends to humans and the the world,
        because
        <a
          href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/87465/oxygen-factories-in-the-southern-ocean"
          >plankton produce over 50% of the earths oxygen</a
        >. When taking into account both the 900 million kilograms of carbon
        dioxide that were not emitted into the atmosphere and the rise in oxygen
        production from increased plankton, this creates a powerful combination
        in the fight against global warming.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3>
        The species of plankton in the wild appears to be more biodiverse after
        the release of the oil. Ozhan states that "<a
          href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/9/829/269288"
          >The study</a
        >
        showed that there was a larger number of taxa, a greater diversity of
        diatom species, and an insignificant number of deformed phytoplankton
        valves relative to historical data from prior to the oil spill." This
        increase in biodiversity and decrease in deformed phytoplankton should
        help them grow further in the future and increase the planktons
        resistance to diseases and mass extinctions.

        Another benefit of the oil release is the population boom of Hydroids,
        colonies of thousands of smaller organisms that form a larger being.

        >, a species that is able to lay the foundation for many other types of
        marine life to thrive in an area and turn it into a lively ecosystem.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3>
        This drastic growth of the hydroid population is discussed in
        <a
          href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320717320116"
          >a study</a
        >
        by Fanny Girard. She shows that even seven years after the release of
        the oil, the hydroid population is still much higher and more biodiverse
        than it was before. She states that the population may stay at this new
        level for over 50 years, depending on how the oceanic climate changes in
        that timeframe. This means many new oceanic "forests" may be made in the
        years to come.

      <h3>
        While some may be quick to jump to conclusions about the BP oil release,
        its mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide and promotion of
        phytoplankton and hydroid growth may just be the evidence that people
        need to hear to change their mind.
